## Exercise: Student Database

#### Objective:

Practice using HashMap to create a simple student database.

#### Description:

Create a program that simulates a student database using a HashMap. The program should allow users to add student names and their corresponding IDs, retrieve student IDs using their names, display the database, and exit the program.

#### Guidelines:

- Create a HashMap to store student names as keys and their corresponding IDs as values.
- Implement a loop that displays a menu with the following options:
    - Add student
    - Retrieve student ID
    - Display database
    - Exit

Depending on the selected option, perform the following tasks:

1.	To add a student, take input from the user for the student's name and ID, and add it to the HashMap.
2.	To retrieve a student ID, take input from the user for the student's name and look up their ID in the HashMap.
3.	To display the database, iterate through the HashMap and print each student's name and ID.
4.	To exit, terminate the program.
